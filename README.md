# chatbot
In the above snippet of code, we have defined a variable that is an instance of the class "ChatBot". 
We have included various parameters within the class. 
The first parameter, 'name', represents the name of the Python chatbot.
Another parameter called 'read_only' accepts a Boolean value that disables (TRUE) or enables (FALSE) the ability of the bot to learn after the training. We have also included another parameter named 'logic_adapters' that specifies the adapters utilized to train the chatbot.
While the 'chatterbot.logic.MathematicalEvaluation' helps the chatbot solve mathematics problems, the ` helps it select the perfect match from the list of responses already provided.
Since we have to provide a list of responses, we can perform it by specifying the lists of strings that we can use to train the Python chatbot and find the perfect match for a certain query.
